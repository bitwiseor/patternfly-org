A **title** component applies top and bottom margins, font-weight, font-size, and line-height to titles.

**Keyboard users** should not be able to reach a title using **Tab**, as titles are not interactive.

**Screen reader users** should be able to navigate to the title and read its text.

## To make title accessible:
- Choose appropriate headings to indicate sections and subsections of content rather than choosing heading levels for their formatting.
