A **backdrop** is used to screen the main content of a page when a modal overlay is opened. It prevents the user from doing other work on the page until the modal is dismissed.
 
**Keyboard users** sshould not be able to interact with or navigate to the backdrop, as they must address the modal overlay until the modal is dismissed.
 
**Screen reader users** should also not be able to interact with the backdrop for the same reasons.

No additional actions or props are needed to make a backdrop accessible.
